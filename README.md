# Phone Gallery

Sample project made for an interview test.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), but its scaffolding was customized in the likes of the developer.
Some design decisions are inherited from the test requirements.

## Local development

### Installation

Run `npm install` after you clone this repo to install depencencies of both Front and Back apps. Depending on your enviroment, you might need to globally install `@angular/cli`.

## Local server with hot code swap

Run `npm run start` to start the local server. The backend will be avaliable at `http://localhost:4100/` and the frontend at `http://localhost:4200/`. Thanks to ng-cli, this app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the front project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
